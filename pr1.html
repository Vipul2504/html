<p><hr><b>Since looking directly at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness</b>,<i>special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar
eclipse</i>.It is safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the unaided eye and without protection. This practice must be undertaken carefully,
though the extreme fading of the solar brightness by a factor of over 100 times in the<br> last minute before totality makes it obvious when totality has begun and it is
for that extreme variation and the view of the solar corona that leads people to travel to the zone of totality (the partial phases span over two hours while the total
</br>phase can only last a maximum of <sub>10</sub>2 minutes for any one location and is usually less). People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel even to remote
locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.</hr></p>
